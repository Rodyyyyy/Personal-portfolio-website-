# Professional AI/ML Engineering Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for my professional portfolio website. Designed to showcase my trajectory as a **Computer Engineering student at Alamein International University**, the project highlights my expertise in **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Java Development**.

The site is built with a focus on **Modern UI/UX principles**, high-performance rendering, and a mobile-first responsive architecture. It serves as a central hub for my technical projects, certifications (DEPI, ITI), and leadership roles within the tech community.

## Technical Features

### UI/UX & Design
- **Glassmorphism Design:** Utilizes semi-transparent layers with `backdrop-filter: blur()` for a high-end, modern aesthetic.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Strategically organized sections using CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure technical skills and projects are immediately visible.
- **Interactive States:** Custom CSS keyframe animations and smooth transition effects on hover to improve user engagement.
- **Brand Consistency:** A custom-themed navy and teal palette (`#0a192f` & `#64ffda`) reflecting a professional developer environment.

### Core Architecture
- **Responsive Layout:** Fluid design using `clamp()` for typography and media queries to ensure 100% compatibility across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Optimized Performance:** Minimalist code structure with zero external heavy libraries, resulting in near-instant load times.
- **Sticky Glass Header:** A functional navigation bar that follows the user with a blurred background effect for seamless navigation.
- **Semantic HTML5:** Built with accessibility and SEO best practices in mind using semantic tags.
